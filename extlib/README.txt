This directory is is a standard location for building the cloudregistry-epp-rtk library from source.
If you wish to build the source by yourself (using the build.xml in the top level directory), unpack
epp-rtk-java-0.9.6.tar.gz (obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/epp-rtk/files/) into this directory.
